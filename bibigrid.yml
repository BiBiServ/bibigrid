  # First configuration also holds general cluster information and must include the master.
  # All other configurations mustn't include another master, but exactly one vpngtw instead (keys like master).

- infrastructure: openstack # former mode. Describes what cloud provider is used (others are not implemented yet)
  cloud: openstack # name of clouds.yaml cloud-specification key (which is value to top level key clouds)

  # -- BEGIN: GENERAL CLUSTER INFORMATION --
  ## sshPublicKeyFiles listed here will be added to access the cluster. A temporary key is created by bibigrid itself.
  #sshPublicKeyFiles:
  #  - [public key one]

  ## Volumes and snapshots that will be mounted to master
  # autoMount: False # warning: will overwrite unidentified filesystems
  #masterMounts: # KEY NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET
  #  - [mount one]

  #nfsShares: # KEY NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET; /vol/spool/ is automatically created as a nfs
  #  - [nfsShare one]

  ## Ansible (Galaxy) roles can be added for execution # KEY NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
  #ansibleRoles:
  #  - file: SomeFile
  #    hosts: SomeHosts
  #    name: SomeName
  #    vars: SomeVars
